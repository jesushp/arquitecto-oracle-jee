* D. When stateful session bean instance is removed, the container detaches the timers associated with the instance and allocates them to the new instance.
* **E. When a transaction is rolled back, the timer creation within the transaction is also rolled back.**

B,E

	(B) “Timers are persistent by default. If the server is shut down or crashes, persistent timers are saved and will become active again when the server is restarted. If a persistent timer expires while the server is down, the container will call the @Timeout method when the server is restarted.”
	(E) True; jee 6 tutorial: “An enterprise bean usually creates a timer within a transaction. If this transaction is rolled back, the timer creation also is rolled back. Similarly, if a bean cancels a timer within a transaction that gets rolled back, the timer cancellation is rolled back. In this case, the timer’s duration is reset as if the cancellation had never occurred.”


The integration team has reported a problem in testing a few deployed MDBs. By design, each MDB listens to one of four named queues. Two producers write messages to each
queue. The test issues messages of the same payload type that each producer will send, but varies the number or size of these messages to measure the messaging server’s
performance.
The team has noticed that the utilization remains at the same high rate any time the test writes messages destined for the third MDB. The message server log does not reveal any
failure in sending messages to this MDB.
